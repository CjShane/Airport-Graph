Have to go to https://opencagedata.com/dashboard#geocoding and enter the API into AirportDistanceCalculator and ensure you keep the opencagedata website open.
Currently there is only support for the airports list in airports.txt
routes.txt is just a file with routes for the program to run and calculate which airports will need to be stopped at for connecting flights and the distance between airports as well as the total distance
